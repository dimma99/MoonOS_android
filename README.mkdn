MoonOS
===========

Trying to build a rom my own for learning purpose. 

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/MoonOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the MoonOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/dimma99/MoonOS_android -b lineage-19.1
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
